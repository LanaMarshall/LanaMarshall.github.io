I’m Lana Marshall, a multidisciplinary designer based in Seattle. I have 10 years of experience including product-side and agency positions, from startups to international corporations. My design work covers a wide variety of genres, including product design, graphic design, branding, iconography, illustration, social media marketing campaigns, motion graphics and print. My professional experience includes 4 1/2 years of working for tech startups, where I learned to understand and thrive in a fast-paced, creative, high energy culture with cross-functional collaboration. I also come with a solid working knowledge of HTML and CSS, having completed a 12-week front end development boot camp. When I’m not working, I enjoy biking, traveling and film photography.

If you have questions about my work or are interested in working together, please feel free to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.
