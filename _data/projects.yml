  description: "Microsoft Pay is a digital wallet that allows users to easily and securely complete payments across various sites and platforms."
  problem: The Microsoft Store lacked a way to easily access stored payment and shipping information when making purchases. Additionally, Microsoft brand loyalists desired a digital wallet solution outside of Apple Pay and Google Pay. 
  solution: I worked with a Senior Designer on the store team to craft a digital wallet that Microsoft loyalists could trust and use within the Microsoft Store, as well as across the web. Users can save multiple addresses and cards for easy access later. 
  role: I was in charge of the visual and UI design for this project. I also created original illustrations that fit within Microsoft's brand guidelines and animated those illustrations.

  description: "Surface Configurator walks customers through buying options to help them easily select a new Surface Laptop. The configurator was customized for smooth experiences on mobile, desktop and Xbox."
  problem: When purchasing a Surface laptop or custom Xbox controller, Microsoft customers were presented with a long list of options, some of which were technical. The process of selecting these options needed to be more smooth, intuitive and organized.
  solution: Breaking down the configuration steps into categories with helpful tips offered along the way created a less overwhelming user experience. 
  role: I was in charge of the visual and UI design for this project. I worked with a senior designer who offered UX guidance and feedback.

  description: "RideScout, an Austin startup known for their trip planning app, hired me as a freelancer to create an animated explainer video for their new SDK and mobility network RideTap. The new SDK allowed apps to offer multi-modal, real-time transportation options to their users. </br></br> After completing a series of illustrations and animating them into a one minute video, I was invited to join the RideScout team as a full time Visual Designer to be there for the ideation and launch of RideTap. Once on team RideScout (later moovel), I created a logo, marketing materials, email banners, landing pages and UI design for RideTap and more. </br></br> In May 2016, the RideTap pilot launched in Portland, Oregon with Lyft and Car2go accessible through the TriMet mobile ticketing app, Portland's public transportation agency app."

  description: "After Austin-based RideScout and Portland-based GlobeSherpa began the process of merging to form moovel North America, the offices joined forces to help revamp the white label mobile ticketing app that had been developed by the Portland team and used by transit agencies around the country. One thing lacking in the existing app was a trip planning tool. The moovel team set out to make a clean, functional and user-friendly trip planner that could be utilized in a variety of settings and transit systems. </br></br> My role in this project was UI design. I worked closely with product managers to help translate user testing feedback into design improvements."

It can be closed quickly to access other areas of the app and reopens in the spot the user left off. The screen on the right is an empty state shown on the first time user experience."

      caption: Recently searched locations are remembered and displayed below the search bar when Trip Planner is opened. This allows the user to quickly pull up trip results.

      header: Trip Results
      caption: "Once the user selects a destination, Trip Planner displays three route options in one of two ways - a swipeable card view or list view. The user can switch between views by tapping the list or card view icon to the left of the settings icon. This design is intentionally similar to RideTap so that the two could be integrated at some point in the future. </br>The user's current location is assumed as the starting point, but can be edited. From this screen, the user can swipe through trip options and select their preferred route or access trip and time settings."

      caption: "By tapping the clock icon, users can plan what time they'd like to start their trip or what time they'd like to arrive at their destination up to 30 days into the future. Tapping the gear icon opens Route Options, where users can customize sorting options and preferred transit methods. Here, users also have the ability filter out route options that don't meet ADA accessibility standards."

      header: Up to Date Alerts
      caption: "One challenge we faced was how to alert users of not only line-specific service alerts, but system-wide alerts as well. The yellow alert icon lets the user know there are service alerts for the trip and the banner at the top of the direction list can be tapped to open detailed information about said alerts."

      caption: "As the user scrolls through their trip directions, the map updates to show the corresponding leg of the trip. Each transit segment includes real-time arrival info and metadata icons to indicate if the train or bus is wheelchair accessible or has wifi or bike racks.

I cleaned up the lines of the logo, simplified the details and color scheme and added new logotype. The logo update was just part of Social Distillery's brand refresh, which included comprehensive brand guidelines and new brand collateral."
